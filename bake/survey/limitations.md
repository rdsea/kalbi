### Recored limitations in the conducting survey

1. Sometimes I faced problems with Metamask. There have been times when I initiate a transaction, but the Metamask popup didn't appear. In this way the transactions got piled up and become messy

6. Documentation could have been better
--> answer from respondent id `11518800474` in `all responses.csv`

7. I work for creating a smart contract. But I haven't found an IDE which can support all types of contracts. For example, If there was a single IDE in which I can write, debug the contracts written For different blockchain like Ethereum, Tron, EOS then I would be very easy. Currently, I use some online IDE to write and test the contract which is pretty difficult
